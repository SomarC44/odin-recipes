# odin-recipes
This will be my first project since starting The Odin Project.
I will be making use of all of my newly acquired html skills and knowledge. 
I will be creating a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will link to a few recipes.
I will make use of unordered and ordered lists, as well as href's
and img elements.  
This website will be built using only html elements, for now. 
SIC PARVIS MAGNA!
