    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is for a traditional levantine dish comprised of
    fried burgul morsels with lamb meat fillings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>The Filling</h4>

    <p>The filling is comprised of pan-fried chunks of ground lamb 
    meat mixed with caramelized white onions. This creates a rich
    mix between the sweet and savory flavors.</p>

    <h4>The Spices</h4>
    
    <p>You can find ready-mixed kibbeh spices at any 
    levantine food store, but it is always better to make your  
    own. You have more control on the flavors this way.</p>

    <p>For a proper traditional seven spice mix we'll need:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>5 tbsp garam masala or allspice</li>
      <li>2 tbsp turmeric</li>
      <li>2 tbsp black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tbsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
      <li>1 tbsp coriander</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Meat</h4>

    <p>For best results, we use a mix of lamb and beef mince.
    This ensures our meat is not too fatty, but also tender enough.
    The fattier lamb mince will also allow us to form the meat 
    better.I like to use a 50:50 mix, but feel free to experiment
    to your heart's delight!</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix 2 lb of lamb and beef mince in 50:50 proportion and divide into two equal portions</li>
      <li>Chop 1 head of onion into a medium dice</li>
      <li>Mix 1 lb of the mince and onions, and pan fry on medium heat until golden brown</li>
      <li>Mix 1 lb of fine burgul with 1 lb of the mince and form small circlets</li>
      <li>Fill each ciclet with a generous amount of our pan-fried meat and form into a closed elipse shaped dumpling</li>
      <li>Fry dumplings in oil until golden brown in color</li>
      <li>Serve with a garlic-yoghurt mix</li>
    </ol>
